#A Reference for Sisters Seeking Advice on Ruqyah in the Bradford Area

From the blessings of Allāh that I remind myself of is being able to travel all over the UK, and indeed all over the world, as part of *da'wah* related activities. During those trips, I have dealt with many *ruqyah* cases; offering advice and support to the best of my ability. 

After regular trips to the wider Bradford area, I was involved in a number of cases which related to sisters. During these cases, I came to know of sister Farzana Hussain, from Halifax, who has been supporting female patients in a number of difficult cases.

The sister is a person who has well-grounded knowledge and extensive experience in the field of ruqyah, and I have personally referred a number of sisters to her for advice and support. During these referrals and cases, I have read and heard the advice that she has offered and seen some of the support that she has provided in some of the most difficult and challenging cases, and found it to be of an excellent standard, in accordance with the Book of Allāh and the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ; as well as being appropriate for a sister, and in accordance with the modesty which all Muslims are commanded to uphold.

I have also come to know that the sister is active in teaching and supporting women in the local area, and I have seen some of the material that she teaches from, and found it to be in accordance with the Book of Allāh, the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ, and the methodology of the pious predecessors. I understand that the sister has contact with a number of people of knowledge in this regard, and that they offer advice on matters that she cannot answer.

I would have no hesitation in recommending the sister as a person to seek advice and support from in the matter of ruqyah, as well as other Islamic matters, and for the sisters in that area in general.

I have posted this reference as a private link on my website muhammadtim.com, so that you can be confident that this reference is indeed from me. I would request that those who read this keep it private, in order that the sister is not burdened with more cases and questions than she can manage. This reference was written as I understand that people wish to know the reliability of the information that they receive, and in accordance with the statement, "Indeed, this knowledge is [your] religion; so look at whom you take your religion from."

This is what I know from the limited knowledge that Allāh has given me, and only Allāh knows the true nature of a person.

Wassalāmu 'alaykum warahmatullāhi wa barakātuhu, 

Muhammad Tim.
