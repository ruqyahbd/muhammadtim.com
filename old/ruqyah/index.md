#Information for Ruqyah Patients

**At the moment, both myself and my ruqyah partner Basak are abroad. We aren't scheduled to be back in Newcastle for a few months, and even then, we are not expecting to be back for long. We have some students who are learning ruqyah at the moment, and whom we hope will take over the responsibility while we are abroad, but they aren't ready to take on new cases yet.**

Further updates will be provided soon, in shaa' Allah.
