#7 Day Ruqyah Detox Programme - Shaykh ‘Adil ibn Ṭahir al-Muqbil

**NOTE FOR RAMAḌĀN: There's no reason why you can't implement this programme in Ramaḍān, simply drink the mixture at maghrib, after *taraaweeḥ*, and before fajr, or as close as you can.**


بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

ترجمة "الأشفية" لفضيلة الشيخ عادل بن طاهر المقبل - حفظه الله تعالى -

This programme is recommended by our Shaykh ‘Adil ibn Ṭahir al-Muqbil (may Allāh protect and preserve him), for all those people who complain of problems relating to jinn, magic, and the evil eye. The shaykh said that he has used it for many years with a great deal of success, and it is particularly relevant for those who are waiting to see a raaqi, or can't get access to one. The shaykh calls it "The [collection of] Cures" because it is made up of a number of things that we are told are *shifaa'* in the Qur'aan and the Sunnah.

A number of people ask: "Where is the proof for this from the Qur'ān and the Sunnah?" We say that - in shā' Allāh - there is a proof for each of the points mentioned as individual cures, but as for doing them as a whole, then this is something that is from the permissible *ijtihaad* of the shaykh. This is something allowed, as evidenced by the following statement of Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allāh have mercy upon him):

> "Seeking a cure with the Noble Qur’ān and Sidr and the likes are from the permissible medicines and do not fall within the category of innovation, rather they fall within the category of medicine. The Prophet ﷺ said, 'O Slaves of Allāh, seek a cure and do not seek a cure from the harām.' And it is authentically reported in Sunan Abī Dawood that the Prophet ﷺ read upon water in a vessel and poured it over a sick person. From this we know that seeking a cure by reading over water and honey and the likes are permissible, and there is nothing wrong with them from an Islamic point of view, as long as what is read on them is correct, and the medicine [i.e., water, honey, etc] is something permissible [to eat/drink]." [Explanation of *Fatḥ al-Majeed*]

However, this does give us an important benefit, which is that as long as the programme is not - as a whole - mentioned in the Sunnah, then it is not necessary for every single part to be carried out without any change. So, if a diabetic cannot eat honey, they can miss it out, and although we would recommend doing the programme exactly as mentioned, we hope that there is no harm in that.

The two most commonly asked questions since I posted this article are:

1. **Can a lady do this programme when she is menstruating?** The answer is that it depends on her need. If she is able to delay the programme until after the time of menstruation, then perhaps this is better. However, if she can't wait, then there is no specific reason to prevent her from doing so, and she should avoid the areas where there is menstrual blood.
2. **Isn't it forbidden to use ruqyah water in the bath?** The answer is that this was the opinion of some of the students of knowledge. We say that there is no evidence for this prohibition. If ruqyah water had the same ruling as the Qur'ān, it would not be permissible to drink it, or to put it on the body, or to bathe with it. We asked the shaykh this question, and he confirmed that there is no reason to treat ruqyah water like the Qur'ān.

I have added some small notes from myself, to clarify certain things. These are in {...}

**Before beginning:**

1. Humble yourself before Allah
2. Make du‘aa at the times when your du‘aa is accepted, like the time between the *adhaan* and the *iqaamah*, the last third of the night, between 'Asr and Maghrib on a Friday (because the Prophet - may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him - [said](http://sunnah.com/muslim/6/200), "Indeed on the day of Jumu'ah there is a period of time, no believing servant encounters it, asking Allah for the good of this world and the next, except that he is given it."), and so on. {See: [http://duas.com/tips.php](http://duas.com/tips.php)}

**You need to have the following things ready:**

1. **Water** {I estimate you'll need 3-5 litres per person approximately} - ideally Zam Zam, because of the [hadeeth](http://www.binbaz.org.sa/node/19851) "A food that satisfies and a cure from sickness", and the [hadeeth](http://sunnah.com/urn/1331790) "The water of Zam Zam is for whatever it is drunk for." If Zam Zam is not available, then rain water should be collected, because Allah said, "And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest" [50:9](http://quran.com/50/9), and because the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to uncover part of his garment when it rained, and [he would say](http://sunnah.com/abudawud/43/328), "It has just come from its Lord." If rain water is not available, then regular water is fine, but effort should be made to obtain rain water where Zam Zam is not available. {**Please do not delay the programme excessively waiting for Zam Zam or rain water - you can always add it later in shaa' Allah**}
2. **Olive Oil** {One whole bottle per person should be enough} - {this should be organic Cold Pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil - in other words, it should be greenish in colour, not yellow like vegetable oil. I recommend organic Palestinian extra virgin olive oil, if you can get it, because it comes from a land that Allāh tells us is blessed}. This is because Allah describes it as "lit from [the oil of] a blessed tree - the olive" [24:35](http://quran.com/24/35), and the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [said](http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/25/69), "Eat olive oil and oil yourselves with it, for it is from a blessed tree." 
3. **Honey** {this should be raw & organic, and of good quality...not supermarket junk! You can get Sidr honey, also Manuka honey is well spoken of}. Allah said, "There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought." [16:69](http://quran.com/16/69) and the Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [said](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/76/3), There is a cure in three substances, a drink of honey…" [al-Bukhari]. The shaykh emphasised that a lot of people make a mistake in that they do not drink the honey, but they eat it, and the hadeeth is clear that the cure is in drinking it diluted in water.
4. **Black Seeds** {again this should be organic - the scientific name is Nigella Sativa}. This is because the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [said](http://sunnah.com/muslim/39/120), "It is a cure from every illness" [Bukhari and Muslim].

At the beginning of the week, you need to do the following:

1. Sit down with the water and olive oil open in front of you. Read the following:

       (a) [**al-Faatihah**](http://quran.com/1) - seven times is best, or three if you wish, because the Prophet ﷺ [approved of doing so](http://notes.muhammadtim.com/ruqyah/quranasacure).
       (b) [**al-Baqarah**](http://quran.com/2) - once all the way through (If you are unable to read al-Baqarah, then read whatever is easy for you, or ask someone to read for you, if you struggle to read the Qur'an).
       (c) **The last three surahs of the Qur'an: [al-Ikhlaaṣ](http://quran.com/112), [al-Falaq](http://quran.com/113), and [an-Naas](http://quran.com/114)** - three times each.
       (d) **Aayat-ul-Kursi** [2:255](http://quran.com/2/255) - seven times is best, or three if you wish.

2. Blow {as though you are spitting but without spittle}, either at the end of each sūrah, or after each aayah, or whenever it is easy for you, into the water and the olive oil {You can use smaller bottles and blow in each from time to time, or in all of them after each aayah or each sūrah, it's up to you. Perhaps it would be even more beneficial to read 2 litres at a time during the week, to get the most out of the reading}. When you have completed all of the reading, you are now prepared to begin the programme.

**How to use:**

1. Take two tablespoons of honey and dissolve them in a cup of the water that you have read upon. Add seven seeds of black seed and drink. Do this three times per day.
2. Before sleep, anoint the entire body from head to foot with the olive oil that has been read upon.
3. Upon waking, wash the entire body with water and soap. Then, take half a cup of the water that has been read upon and add it to a bucket or other container. Fill up the bucket with water from the tap and wash the entire body.

***Continue this for three whole days***

**On day 4-7:**

1. Use olive oil that has been read upon to anoint any areas where pain is found, if any.
2. Take two tablespoons of honey and dissolve them in a cup of the water that you have read upon. Add seven seeds of black seed and drink. Do this three times per day.

**What to Expect:**

1. On the first day, you will most likely not feel anything.
2. On the second and third day, you may feel very ill. You may feel excessive tiredness, pain all over the body, or in certain places, or aches and pains as though you carried out strenuous exercise.
3. By the fourth day, you may feel completely refreshed, as though you have a lot of energy - with the permission of Allah.
4. The aches and pains will gradually go away, in shaa' Allah, over the course of the 7 days.
5. {If the patient does not feel better, or the 7 day programme has resulted in a worsening of symptoms, then we advise to move on to the [full ruqyah programme](http://muhammadtim.com/programme), of which the 7 day programme is repeated 1-2 times a month, in addition to other ruqyah.}
