####Question

I feel that I can't carry out your ruqyah programme - it's just too much for me. If there was one thing that you would advise me to do, what would it be?

####Answer

Firstly, we should be clear that whatever is recommended in this post should be seen as a stepping stone to one of the ruqyah treatments that are described elsewhere on the website, such as the blog post [Where Do I Start?](/posts/where-do-i-start)

However, I also recognise that some people are unlikely to be able to reach that level in one go, so we have to start with something smaller than this goal, and work upwards. Don't worry if you read what I am advising and think, "I'm already doing this!" - that's a good thing, because it's easy, and we can build on it from there.

In deciding what to start with, I reflected upon the following texts:

> **"Say, 'My Lord would not care about you, if it were not for your supplication.'"** [25:77](http://quran.com/25/77)

> **"And your Lord said, 'Call upon Me; I will respond to you.'"** [40:60](http://quran.com/40/60)

> A man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, "O Messenger of Allah, the legislated acts of Islam have become too much for me, so inform me of something that I should stick to." He (ﷺ) said, "Let your tongue not cease to be moist with the remembrance of Allāh." [at-Tirmidhi](http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/48/6)

What these texts make clear to me is that when things become too much, and you don't know where to start, then the answer is to start with remembrance and supplication.

Based upon this, I would advise to start with the following:

* The programme recommended on: [muhammadtim.com/protectys](/protectys) - these are simple and short words of remembrance and supplication which Allāh revealed as a means of protection.
* [The du'aa of Ayyub](http://duas.com/dua/471/dua-from-the-quran-12), which brought relief from all of his affliction
* [The du'aa of Yunus](http://duas.com/dua/472/dua-from-the-quran-13), through which Allāh promised to save every believer who calls upon Him.
* [This comprehensive du'aa for a number of problems](http://duas.com/dua/280/dua-when-in-debt-2), including anxiety and depression, inability and laziness.

However, to do all of these, you will also need to be aware of the etiquette of du'aa, so that you have the ability to do what is needed for your du'aa to be accepted. For this reason, I'd recommend that you to start by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYgBOpHtqzE&feature=youtu.be).
